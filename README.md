This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is created for an exercise for a mindful approach to everyday spending. In additing transactions, the spending plan that you are actually living is populated. 

Once all the transactions for a month or two are entered, you can create your Spending Plan based on your actual spending and any desired changes to that plan.

When the Monthly Spending Plan has been created, and you continue to add transactions you will have a "planned spending column" and an "actual spending column"

These two columns are compared and the difference reflects in the Diff column so you can see how you are doing with your plan. 

Most important, is to add all transactions no matter how small, and be consistent with categories.
